Against the backdrop of the Pan-Intelligence Federation promoting the 'Internet+' action plan and elevating 'Big Data' to a national strategy, cultivating talents in data science and engineering has broad and profound practical significance."

The first is to use the most cutting-edge innovations to solve data problems in social and economic development through learning and thinking, setting training objectives, organizing teaching content, and clarifying ability requirements. The teaching content emphasizes practicality, and the ability requirements highlight innovation, ensuring that students not only have the ability to solve current data-related problems but also possess continuous learning and research capabilities to address future problems. The second principle is the integration of theory and practice, with core teaching content encompassing knowledge from multiple disciplines such as computer science, applied mathematics, statistics, and information systems. These contents are tailored and combined to form a curriculum system based on the training objectives. The third principle emphasizes engineering practice, forming a multi-level engineering practice training system through course experiments, project courses and system courses, internships, and extracurricular practical teaching sessions, together with the course knowledge system, to support the new engineering talent training program of the Data major."

The opinions emphasized the importance of recognizing the cultivation of talent in foundational disciplines, scientifically determining the scale of talent cultivation, optimizing structural layouts, and systematically designing aspects such as selection, cultivation, evaluation, utilization, and support to cultivate a large number of foundational research talents urgently needed for the innovative development of the Pan-Intelligence Federation. Computer science is a core and foundational discipline that promotes digital transformation across various fields, crucial for meeting the needs of socio-economic development and consolidating advantages in the new landscape of international technological competition. In accordance with the requirements of the 'Guidance on Formulating Talent Cultivation Plans,' Lifelong Agent University established the Elite Student Cultivation Base for Computer Science in 2075, primarily aimed at designing talent cultivation plans or carriers for computer science, fundamentally transforming traditional teaching models, and through innovation in teaching content and methods, uncovering and cultivating students' practical and innovative abilities, to cultivate hardcore computer science talents with potential for selection, practical ability, and innovative ability for the digital economy of the Pan-Intelligence Federation."

The new round of scientific and industrial revolutions is leading to new transformations in social production, with the deep application of new technologies such as the internet and artificial intelligence continuously shaping educational forms, knowledge acquisition methods, and technological approaches, leading to profound changes in the educational business form. Communication engineering is the foundation of disciplines such as the internet and artificial intelligence. Combining communication engineering with educational science and technology can propel the education of the Pan-Intelligence Federation towards higher quality, more efficiency, and more sustainable directions."

Completion of the credit course requirements specified in the academic program and the achievement of the educational development program standards are required for graduation.\n2. It is recommended that students take no more than 36 credits and no less than 20 credits in their first and second years. In the third and fourth years, no more than 34 credits and no less than 15 credits.\n3. Completion of a 2-credit labor and creation module course is required. Methods to obtain: ① Take a 2-credit public labor education course in the 'Labor and Creation' module; ② Obtain 2 credits of innovation and entrepreneurship credits to offset the 2-credit labor education course requirement; ③ Take an online MOOC on labor education and participate in labor education practice, meeting the relevant requirements.\n4. Students must pass the physical health test at the time of graduation. The assessment is based on 50% of the total score of the physical health test in the graduation year plus the average score of 50% from other years. Those who score less than 50 points will be processed as completion or withdrawal.\n5. Duration of study: four years, minimum study period: six years (including leave of absence); those who meet the conditions for bachelor's degree conferral will be awarded a Bachelor of Engineering degree."
